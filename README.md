# Buffer Overflow
This is a simple buffer overflow I coded in C programming language. <br>
In order to execute this one , save this file with .c extension since it's a file written in C. <br>

After that, use the terminal to navigate to the path where you saved the file. <br>
Type this: <br>

<code>
  gcc file.c
</code>

Now type: 

<code> 
  ./a.out
</code>

Now you are able to type a string of any size and <b> <u> you'll get your Buffer Overflow executed. </b> </u>

<b> Be aware that I do not have any responsability in case you use this code in the wrong way. </b>
